notes for life distribution

+ use linear YUV space to generate lightened colours
+ allow colours to be specified in spreadsheet
+ fix guides being duplicated when changing alignment
+ fix guides not deactivating when changing alignment
+ element listings should be coloured
+ remove button borders
- move alignment and guide controls to top right
- allow highlighting months of year, years, and decades
+ remove 'guide' layer listing
- sort mesh height by size of element so smallest is on top
- fade other elements to low opacity instead of hiding them when mousing over one
- show all applicable element details depending on mouse position
- highlight currently selected listings/options
- show very faded guides for areas preceding/following the lifetime
- include togglable edge-detected hilbert curve overlay to make contiguous time areas easier to see
+ fix '1984s' to say '1980s'
- show 'start to end time' and 'total contiguous time' separately for multi-block elements
- show individual date ranges (smaller, underneath main start/end dates) for multi-block elements
- element details should be coloured
- implement weeks guide (no labels)
- add option for automatic panning and zooming
- allow mousewheel scrolling and drag-to-pan
+ limit width of element labels and add darkened backing beyond outline
- allow aligning to beginning, middle or end of square time period instead of always the beginning
- fix off-by-one issues with alignment by months etc
- calculate time spans by comparing year/month/day values rather than using absolute number of days
+ move edges inwards so adjacent areas' edges don't overlap

+ height order:
--- element labels
--- guide labels
--- element edges
--- guide edges
--- element meshes
